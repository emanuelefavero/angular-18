# Angular 18

<img src="./public/logo.png" alt="logo" width="32">

This repository is a playground for **Angular 18**. Feel free to use it to test new features and functionalities.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install Angular CLI globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `ng serve` or `npm start` to start the development server
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Angular CLI

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component components/component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Create a new Angular project

To create a new Angular project, run `ng new project-name`. This will create a new Angular project with the name `project-name`.

> To create a new Angular project with `ssr` (Server Side Rendering) support, run `ng new --ssr`.
> Just remember that deploying an Angular application with SSR is a bit more complex than a regular Angular application (which will even work easily with GitHub pages and Vercel)
> @see [https://angular.dev/guide/ssr](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr) for more information on Angular SSR.
